# Display Odd Numbers from 1 to 10 using range()

This Python script demonstrates how to display odd numbers between 1 and 10 using the range() function with a step value.

# What This Program Does

- Uses a for loop with the range() function

- Starts from 1 and increments by 2

- Displays odd numbers from 1 to 9 (inclusive)

 # Explanation
 
- range(1, 10, 2) starts from 1, stops before 10, and increases by 2.

- It generates: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

- These are the odd numbers between 1 and 10 (excluding 10).

# Learning Points

- range(start, stop, step) is used to control the sequence of numbers.

- A step of 2 skips even numbers, making it ideal for generating odd numbers.
